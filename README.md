## Why these extensions? 

### Code Time

Code Time is an open source extension that provides automatic programming metrics directly inside Visual Studio Code. See what time you code best, find your flow, and learn from your data.

### Pomodoro

Pomodoro is a simple pomodoro timer that helps you focus and get in flow. 

The concept behind the Pomodoro Technique is quite simple: focus on a single task for 25 minutes, followed by a 5 minute break. Every fourth break will be a bit longer, at 15 minutes. Following the pomodoro pattern breaks your day into 130-minute intervals.

### Simple Timer

Simple Timer quickly generates a timer in your status bar for however long you'd like, making it a great tool for setting custom time intervals for deep work.

</p>

### Todo Tree

Todo Tree will automatically create a tree in your explorer pane that organizes your TODO and FIXME comments so that you can quickly jump to specific parts of the codebase that need to be reworked. When you open a file, it will also highlight each TODO.

### Bookmarks

Bookmarks enables you to mark and label parts of the codebase that you would like to return to later. When you need to find a bookmark, you can either search through your bookmarks, or use the bookmarks organizer in the Activity Bar.
